# Ukelele US INTL no dead keys layout

The layout is based on `@umanovskis` [win-kbd-usint-nodead](https://github.com/umanovskis/win-kbd-usint-nodead/) which I
use on my windows machines for quite some time now.

I stumbled on this layout in a [superuser.com
Post](https://superuser.com/questions/1133440/us-international-without-dead-keys-layout-windows-10)

Now it is time to make my on version for macOS which is my main operating system at home.

For that I'm using [ukelele](https://software.sil.org/ukelele/) which can be installed via `brew install --cask
ukelele`.

## Why don't use ABC layout

The dead key `¨` for Umlaute like `ä, ü, ö` and their uppercase variants are tedious to type. Since I'm a native german
speaker I use them a lot.
